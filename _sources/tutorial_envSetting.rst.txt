Code and Environment Setting
============================

Code Download
-------------

The method proposed for the identification of biologically relevant clusters
is implemented through a series of Python scripts, publicly available under an
MIT license, that can be downloaded from:
`GitHub: ATTAIN <https://github.com/RodolfoAllendes/attain>`_.

In order to download and use the code, simply use the link provided at the
website to download a ZIP compressed version, and place it at your desired
location.

Alternatively, you can *fork* the repository to your own GitHub account and/or
clone it to local storage using the ``git clone`` command. After forking the
repository on the website, you can use the following commands to clone it:

.. code-block:: console

  ~$ cd <path-to-desired-location>
  ~$ git init
  ~$ git clone https://github.com/RodolfoAllendes/attain.git

After downloading (or cloning) the code's repository, you should be able to see
the following contents (simple explanations are given for each folder):

Anaconda
--------

As the code for ATTAIN is written in Python, you will need a Python interpreter
and some extra libraries before you can execute it. For this, we recommend you
to first install `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_ as a
virtual environment manager.

Anaconda will allow you to keep an isolated version of Python and all other
software requirements, without changing the system's characteristics. Anaconda
is available for Windows, MacOS and Linux systems.

After installing Anaconda, we recommend the definition of new environment, to be
used only by ATTAIN. To create and activate a new conda environment, we use the
following commands:

.. code-block:: console

  ~$ cd <path-to-attain>
  ~attain$ source /<path-to-conda>/bin/activate
  (base) ~attain$ conda create -n attain
  (base) ~attain$ conda activate attain
  (attain) ~attain$

.. note:: Notice that first, we activate conda's base enviroment, and from there
  we create the new environment. The currently active conda environment is
  indicated by its name between parenthesis at the beginning of the console's prompt.

  If during the installation of Anaconda, you included its location in the system's
  path, then the ``conda`` command should be readily available, making it unnecessary to
  load the base enviroment.

Package Installation
--------------------

Your newly created environment will have no packages installed. As ATTAIN was
coded using Python's version 3.6, we start by installing the corresponding
interpreter. You can check that the installation was successful and that the
environment will use our selected interpreter by using the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

  (attain) ~/attain$ conda install python=3.6
  (attain) ~/attain$ python --version
  Python 3.6.12 :: Anaconda, Inc.

In addition to python, a few extra packages are required to execute ATTAIN,
namely these are: ``numpy``, ``pandas``, ``xlrd``, ``markov_clustering`` and
``intermine``. The version used for each of these packages is listed below:

.. code-block:: console

  $ conda list
  #Name                     Version                   Build    Channel
  numpy                     1.16.4           py36h7e9f1db_0
  pandas                    1.0.5            py36h0573a6f_0
  xlrd                      1.2.0                    py36_0
  markov-clustering         0.0.6.dev0               pypi_0    pypi
  intermine                 1.11.0                     py_0    bioconda

To install all the required packages, in the corresponding versions, use the
following commands:

.. code-block:: console

  $ conda install numpy=1.16.4
  $ conda install pandas=1.0.5
  $ conda install xlrd=1.2.0
  $ conda install -c bioconda intermine=1.11.0

  $ pip install markov_clustering[drawing]==-.0.6.dev0

.. note:: The markov_clustering clustering package that we used is only available
  through the pip package manager, thus the change in command.

  Also, some of the packages might require other dependencies to be installed.
  If this is the case, you should accept the modifications suggested by the
  conda package manager.

Jupyter Notebooks
-----------------

A series of Jupyter Notebooks has also been written in an effort to provide
replicability in the analysis of our results, as these are the ones used to 
generate the images used throughout our article. These notebooks are stored 
under the folder ``notebooks`` within ATTAIN's file structure.

A simple Jupyter server can be installed and launched from within your conda
environment by using the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

  $ conda install jupyter
  $ cd notebooks/
  $ jupyter notebook

A new browser window, listing all the notebooks available should be launched.
