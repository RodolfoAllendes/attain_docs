Data Format
-----------

Two different types of files are required as input for our scripts. The first
defines the structure of a PPI network; whilst the second contains the expression
values associated for a given gene in a siRNA screen.

In the following, we provide details on the specific files included in our work;
however, any other combination of files, provided that they follow the same
format, should allow the user to perform its own studies.

Network definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A network is defined via a plain text data file that contains a list of
interactions. Each line of the file contains a tab separated pair of integer
numbers that define a single interaction, found between a pair of nodes. Each
number corresponds to a gene identifier (NCBI GeneID), unique to each gene.

Included in the ``data`` folder of the distributed code is the file that
describes de *Chuang PPI Network*, namely ``network1_chuang.txt``. The first few
lines of this file are as follows:

.. code-block:: console

  6927	55281	HNF1A	TMEM140
  164	8906	AP1G1	AP1G2
  3689	11082	ITGB2	ESM1
  57326	151871	PBXIP1	DPPA2
  5336	23236	PLCG2	PLCB1

Each line is interpreted as the definition of an undirected edge between two
nodes, for example, the first line indicates that there is an edge between gene
HNF1A (id: 6927) and gene TMEM140 (id:55281).

Network Weights
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MCL (Markov Clustering) algorithm is based in the idea that the strength (or
weights) of the links in the network directly influence the way in which the nodes
can be clustered together, thus in order to use the algorithm, we need to provide our
network with some information regarding the edges' weights.

In our experiments, the weights of the edges are derived from siRNA screen readouts
measured at the nodes. Included in the ``data`` folder of the distributed code is
file ``weights1_APP_siRNA.xlsx`` that includes values for four distinct Amylodoigenic
:math:`A\beta` peptides, plus cell viability.

Each row of the table contains the information for a single gene. A gene identifier
(that should match the one used in the network definition file) is included in
column ``GENEID``, whilst values for each readout are given in columns ``VIA``,
``AB40``, ``AB42``, ``SAPPA`` and ``SAPPB``, respectively.

Notice that, in order to use different weight information, a similar file needs
to be provided. In such case the ``GENEID`` has to be included in the file, while
additional rows for readouts can be named arbitrarily.

The first lines of file ``weights1_APP_siRNA.xlsx`` are as follows:

.. code-block:: console

  GENEID  VIA           AB40            AB42            SAPPA           SAPPB

.. warning::

  Although the ``GENEID`` used in both files is the same, that does not mean
  there is a direct match between all genes in both files, this is, there might
  be genes that, even when being part of the network, might not have an
  associated list of readout values.
