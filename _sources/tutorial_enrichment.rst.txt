Cluster Revision and Enrichment
===============================

All clustering results are saved using the CSV format, and thus traditional
spreadsheet software (such as MS Excel) can be used to review the clusters and
their composition.

However, in order to facilitate the inspection and analysis of the generated
cluster, an additional Python script is also available :doc:`cluster_inspection.py <cluster_inspection>`.

Results Inspection
------------------

Execution of the script to inspect results is as follows:

.. code-block:: console

  (attain) ~attain$ python cluster_inspection.py <options>

  -h(--help)
    Show the help and finish execution
  -g(--gene) GENE
    CSV file containing gene information
  -c(--cluster) CLUSTER <optional>
    CSV file containing cluster information

Depending on the files loaded on execution, the information shown by the script
is slightly different:

#.  Single Gene file from (un)weighted experiment: For each GeneID that the user
    inputs, the size of the corresponding cluster is shown.
#.  Single Gene file from randomly weighted experiment: Upon input of a GeneID,
    summary statistics of the clusters to which the gene belongs on each
    randomly weighted experiment are shown.
#.  Gene and Cluster files from an (un)weighted experiment: Number of clusters,
    largest clusters and clustering statistics are shown on load.
    For each GeneID the user inputs, both the size and ID of the cluster to which
    it belongs is shown.

Cluster Enrichment
------------------

In addition to the information of the cluster listed before, each time the user
inputs a GeneID, he is also prompted the option to perform enrichment on the
corresponding cluster.

Enrichment routines currently available are ``Pathway Enrichment``, ``Integrated
Cluster Pathway Enrichment`` and ``Gene Ontology (GO) Enrichment``. All of them
provided through the script's integration to `TargetMine <https://targetmine.mizuguchilab.org>`_.

Before the enrichment process is performed, the user is also able to modify the
parameters associated to it, such as the correction factor used, and the threshold
value used for significance, among others.

.. warning::

  A valid user account in TargetMine is required to correctly execute the
  enrichment routines implemented in ``clustering_inspector.py``. Please remember
  to either include your ``Username`` and ``Password`` combination, or a
  connection ``Token`` when invoking function
  :py:func:`init_service() <clustering_inspector.ClusteringInspector.init_service>`
  of class :class:`ClusteringInspector <clustering_inspector.ClusteringInspector>`.

	Default ``Token`` values are included in the provided code, though there is 
	no warranty about how long these will still be available.

On completion of the enrichment process, the user is prompted to save the results
to a single CSV format output file.

A series of enrichment results are included in the ``results`` folder of our
code distribution. These are named ``chuang_enrich_<readout>_<type>_<gene>.csv``,
where ``<readout>`` represents the readout used to weight the network (the suffix
Rand is used to identify a randomly weighted clustering); ``<type>`` respresents
the enrichment type (Pathway enrichment against the KEGG Pahtway database, or
GO enrichment for biological process or molecular function); and ``<gene>``
represents the geneID used as target (throughout our article we investigate the
behavior of clusters containing APP - gene id 351).

As an example, below is a transcript of the first few lines file
``chuang_enrich_unw_KEGG_APP(BH).csv``, that lists the KEGG Pahtways enriched by 
the cluster containing APP from the unweighted clustering of the Chuang PPI 
Network:

.. code-block:: console

  {'widget': 'gene_pathway_enrichment', 'background': 'backgroundNetwork', 'correction': 'Benjamini Hochberg', 'maxp': 1.0, 'filter': 'KEGG Pathway'}
  
  PathwayID Description                      Avg_P-value Count P-values
