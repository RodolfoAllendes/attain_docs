Welcome to ATTAIN's documentation!
==================================
This site provides supporting details for the execution of the code accompanying
the work presented in the article ''The identification of biologically relevant
protein clusters from siRNA weighted Protein-Protein Interaction Networks.'' by
Miguel L. Camargo, Rodolfo S. Allendes Osorio and Kenji Mizuguchi.

.. note:: ATTAIN is derived from the title of the article as follows:
  The identification of biologicAlly relevanT proTein clusters from sirnA
  weighted protein-protein Interaction Networks.

As part of the documentation, we include a detailed tutorial on how to prepare
your system, execute and replicate all the results listed in the article;
together with the documentation of the code itself.

Tutorial
--------

The following pages will guide you through the replication of all the results
highlighted in the original article, starting with the installation of the required
software.

We hope this content will also serve as guide for users intending to use our
implementation for their own analysis.

This tutorial is divided into the following sections:

#. :doc:`Code and Environment Setting <tutorial_envSetting>`
#. :doc:`Data Format <tutorial_data>`
#. :doc:`Network Generation and Clustering <tutorial_clustering>`
#. :doc:`Cluster Revision and Enrichment <tutorial_enrichment>`

Code
----

The general method described in our article is supported by the implementation
of the following Python scrips:

* :doc:`unweighted_clustering.py <unweighted_clustering>`
* :doc:`weighted_clustering.py <weighted_clustering>`
* :doc:`randomWeight_clustering.py <randomWeight_clustering>`
* :doc:`cluster_inspection.py <cluster_inspection>`

The documentation for the classes consumed by the all the scripts in our
implementation is as follows:

* :doc:`ATTAIN Network <attain_network>`
* :doc:`Clustering Inspector <clustering_inspector>`

Finally, we also provide a set of supplementary Jupyter Notebooks. These were
used for the production of (nearly) all the figures included in the main article:

* :doc:`Additional Jupyter Notebooks <jupyter_notebooks>`
